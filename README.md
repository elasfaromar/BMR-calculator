# BMR Calculator

This is a simple Java program that calculates the basal metabolic rate (BMR) and the number of calories a person should consume daily to achieve their weight management goal. The program takes into account the user's age, gender, current weight, target weight, height, and goal (lose, gain, or maintain weight).
